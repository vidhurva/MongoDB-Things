Exploring the applications of MongoDB

Hello fellow readers! I am exploring the many abilities that MongoDB has to offer. Today, I downloaded the MongoDB software and successfully installed Mongo in my terminal!

Project Overview:
I researched via the magic of internet and youtube tutorials in using this application. I have attached a code snippet which conveys the syntax and information regarding two of my imaginary clients.
Overall, I really like how, unlike other databases that use columns and rows to develop a relationship, MongoDB uses collections and documents. The schemas are LESS restrictive and seem to be applied to most spontaneous forms of data.
